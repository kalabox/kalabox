Kalabox
=======

Kalabox is a free and open source local development environment and workflow tool based on (Docker) container technology. Kalabox allows users to spin up hyper-customized, super-fast development environments and to integrate those environments with their hosting provider or continuous integration workflows.

With Kalabox you can...

  * Easily mimic your production environment on local.
  * Setup, develop, pull and deploy your sites super fast.
  * Standardize your teams dev environments and tools on OSX, Windows and Linux.
  * Easily customize or extend tooling, deployment options and basically any other functionality.
  * Free yourself from the tyranny of inferior local development products.

Kalabox also packages two kinds of special external plugins that generate Drupal, Wordpress, Backdrop or Pantheon based projects. Read about them below.

### Creating Pantheon Apps

The Kalabox Pantheon app generating plugin allows users to...

  3. Push changes back up to their Pantheon site.
  4. Get Pantheon specific power tools such as Terminus, Drush and WP-CLI.

Development Releases
--------------------

We produce development releases for every commit merged into our `v0.13` branch. **These releases are not officially supported** but we have made them available to intrepid users who want to try the bleeding edge or are interested in trying out a recent bug fix before
an official release is rolled.

  * **Windows** - [http://installer.kalabox.io/kalabox-latest-dev.exe](http://installer.kalabox.io/kalabox-latest-dev.exe)
  * **Debian** - [http://installer.kalabox.io/kalabox-latest-dev.deb](http://installer.kalabox.io/kalabox-latest-dev.deb)
  * **Fedora** - [http://installer.kalabox.io/kalabox-latest-dev.rpm](http://installer.kalabox.io/kalabox-latest-dev.rpm)
  * **MacOSX** - [http://installer.kalabox.io/kalabox-latest-dev.dmg](http://installer.kalabox.io/kalabox-latest-dev.dmg)

**NOTE:** Releases can take some time to build after we merge in commits. For that reason you might want to check the time of the last commit and if it is within a few hours you might want to hold off a bit before trying the new latest release.

You can also easily verify that the release you downloaded matches the latest commit. All development releases look something like `0.13.0-alpha.1-4-g63b0db0`. This means 4 commits after the `0.13.0-alpha.1` tag and with commit hash `g63b0db0`. You should make sure this commit hash matches or comes before the latest commit.
