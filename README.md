# Kalabox

**KALABOX HAS REACHED MVP FEATURE COMPLETION BUT SHOULD STILL BE CONSIDERED AN ALPHA VERSION ERGO YMMV AND USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

A framework to build reusable, super fast, highly customizable, extensible and local integrated workflow solutions for all kinds of apps. **You can think about Kalabox as a super-fast, highly-customizable Vagrant for containers.**

Kalabox by default uses the docker toolset as its engine, although this is
swappable with your own custom backend. This means that your current docker
compose files are easily adaptable and likely "drop-in-ready" with Kalabox.

With Kalabox you can

* Easily mimic your production environment on local
* Setup, develop, pull and deploy your sites super fast.
* Standardize your teams dev environments and tools on OSX, Windows and Linux.
* Easily customize or extend tooling, deployment options and basically any other functionality.
* Free yourself from the tyranny of inferior local development products.

For more info on how you can do some of the above check out the [wiki](https://github.com/kalabox/kalabox/wiki).
