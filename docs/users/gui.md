Using the Kalabox GUI
=====================

The Kalabox GUI gives you the ability to easily interact with your sites on Pantheon
and to spin-up stock Drupal, Wordpress, and Backdrop apps. If you're interested
in in-depth information on how the GUI functions, see...

- [Pantheon app docs](http://pantheon.kalabox.io) for how to pull down and work on Pantheon sites.
- [PHP app docs](http://php.kalabox.io) for how to create new Drupal, Wordpress, and Backdrop apps.

!!! note "Note for Kalabox Developers"
    Right now there is no distinction between core GUI features, features dedicated
    to the Pantheon plugin, and features dedicated to the PHP plugin. In the future
    we hope to de-couple these pieces of functionality to reflect the structure that
    the Kalabox CLI functionality has obtained. See [Remove app specific functionality from GUI and move into app projects](https://github.com/kalabox/kalabox/issues/1393) for updates on progress.
