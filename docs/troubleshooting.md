Troubleshooting
===============

Accessing Logs
--------------

Kalabox has a few different log layers to help you diagnose any issues you might be having.

### Install Logs

If you have a failed installation, you should be able to find logs in the following locations...

* **Windows** - `%TEMP%\Setup Log**.txt`
* **macOS** - `/var/log/install.log`
* **Linux** - Differs per system but check common `apt` or `dnf/yum` logs

### Runtime Logs

If you encounter an error during runtime, check out the runtime log at...

  * **macOS/LINUX** - `~/.kalabox/logs/kalabox.log`
  * **Windows** - `C:\Users\{ME}\.kalabox\logs\kalabox.log`

!!! tip "Pro Tip: Use verbose or debug mode!""
    Run the failing command again with either the `-v` or `-d` option to get more useful debug output. But be careful because this output could contain sensitive information.

### Docker Logs

One of the best ways to troubleshoot an issue is to get access to the Kalabox Engine and start hacking around.

!!! tip "Make sure you are ready to run Docker commands on the engine"
    Follow the instructions for [accessing the engine](./general/engine/#accessing-the-engine-directly).

**Some basic Docker commands**

Once you've completed the above you should be able to communicate with your containers. Here are a few helpful commands but please consult the official [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) for a full spec of commands.

**List all my containers**
`docker ps --all`

**List all core kalabox containers**
`docker ps --all | grep kalabox_`

**List all containers for a particular app**
`docker ps --all | grep myappname`

**Inspect a container**
`docker inspect service_myappname_1`

**Check out the logs for a container**
`docker logs service_appname_1`

**Attach to a container (this is like SSHing)**
`docker exec -i -t service_appname_1 bash`

### Container Logs

While you can get container logs by following some of the steps above you can also access specific container logs by mounting them back out onto your host machine. This is done by modifiying your `kalabox-compose.yml` file, which is a normal [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) with a bunch of extra [environmental variables](users/cli/#env) that Kalabox sets for you.

### Example: Sharing your entire logs directory

Here is a basic example of a `kalabox-compose.yml` `php` service that shares the entire `/var/log` directory of your container to `logs` inside of your app's root directory.

```yml
php:
  image: php-7.0
  hostname: $KALABOX_APP_HOSTNAME
  volumes:
    - $KALABOX_APP_ROOT_BIND/logs:/var/log
```

Common Issues
-------------

### Docker daemon is throwing an error

On occasion, and especially while Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows are in beta, the docker daemon will throw an unexpected error. The best thing to do in these circumstances is to restart the docker daemon which you can read more about in our [engine section](./general/engine.md).

If you are having recurring issues that you suspect are primarily docker related then you can try upgrading to the latest Docker for Mac/Windows beta to see if that resolves your issue.

[Docker for Windows BETA](https://download.docker.com/win/beta/InstallDocker.msi)

### Shoddy DNS issues on Windows or slow pull of Docker images

Some users have reported slowness (eg hours) to pull some of the Docker images we need to spin up your sites. It looks like this is a known issue for Docker for Windows. It looks like there is a good workaround here:

[https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#network](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#network)

### Behind a network PROXY or FIREWALL

If you are pulling container images and seeing errors like "Error while pulling image: Get https://index.docker.io/v1/repositories/kalabox/proxy/images: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority" in your macOS/Linux installer log then you might be behind a network proxy or firewall that is preventing you from pulling the needed Kalabox dependencies.

Check out [https://github.com/kalabox/kalabox/issues/1635](https://github.com/kalabox/kalabox/issues/1635) for more details on that issue.

#### DNS Rebinding Protection

Some Routers and Firewalls may prevent Kalabox from properly routing `yoursite.kbox.site` to your local environment through [DNS Rebinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding) protection. DD-WRT router firmware enables this protection by default.

If your site preview fails automatically, and you are unable to look up the url (`nslookup <sitename>.kbox.site)`), DNS rebinding protection may be the cause. If you can't or don't want to remove this protection, you can use the steps in [Working Offline](#working-offline) to bypass.

### Windows is also running VirtualBox

In some cases you cannot use VirtualBox (a common development tool) with Hyper-V however there is a documentated workaround you can check out over at [https://derekgusoff.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/run-hyper-v-and-virtualbox-on-the-same-machine/](https://derekgusoff.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/run-hyper-v-and-virtualbox-on-the-same-machine/)

The author says, "VirtualBox and Hyper-V cannot co-exist on the same machine. Only one hypervisor can run at a time, and since Hyper-V runs all the time, while VirtualBox only runs when it is launched, VirtualBox is the loser in this scenario."

### Working Offline

Kalabox uses a remote DNS server to resolve your `*.kbox.site` addresses which means if you don't have an internet connection you are not going to be able to get to your site. However, you can use your `hosts` file in this scenario. Generally this file is located at `/etc/hosts` on Linux and macOS and `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\host` on Windows. You will need administrative privileges to edit this file.

Here is a [good read](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/) if you are not very familiar with the `hosts` file, how to edit it and how it works.

On Linux you are going to want to point your site to `10.13.37.100` while on macOS and Windows you will want to use `127.0.0.1`. Here are some examples:

#### Adding some domains to Windows/macOS

```bash
127.0.0.1 project-awesome.kbox.site varnish.project-awesome.kbox.site
127.0.0.1 weezer.kbox.rocks
```

#### Adding some domains to Linux

```bash
10.13.37.100 mysite.kbox.host edge.mysite.kbox.host
10.13.37.100 thing.kbox.com
```
