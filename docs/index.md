## Installing

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Kalabox versions pre-0.12.x may be impacted by breaking changes introduced in 0.12. If you have uninstalled a pre-0.12.x version of Kalabox you will want to uninstall using the platform appropriate legacy uninstall script. These are available [here](https://github.com/kalabox/kalabox-cli/tree/447fa1ebc88960f1134322fdef25e6995954f518/scripts).

## Using Kalabox

Right now Kalabox only integrates with Pantheon. We'll be releasing the ability to have "stock" Drupal sites and integrations with other hosting providers soon, but until then, get a [free Pantheon account](https://pantheon.io/register) and create a new Drupal project if you don't already use Pantheon. For more information about
using Pantheon-on-Kalabox check out the [Pantheon Guide](https://github.com/kalabox/kalabox-app-pantheon).

Kalabox also includes a CLI tool. If you open a terminal and run "kbox", you should see a variety of commands to run. Click here for more info on the [CLI tool](https://github.com/kalabox/kalabox-cli).
