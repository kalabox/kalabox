Introduction
============

The Kalabox engine is what powers the container magix of Kalabox. At a high level the engine is just a slightly customized docker daemon. This customization only exists so we do not collide with any of the users' existing docker daemons.

There are a few differences on how this works between Linux and OSX/Windows which are detailed in sections below.

Engine for OSX/Win
------------------

In order to spin up docker containers you need a recent version of the Linux kernel. As you might imagine Windows and OSX do not contain the linux Kernel. As such Kalabox will spin up a small virtual machine during install to do this. The general pieces we use to do this are as follows.

* **VirtualBox** - We use Oracle's [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org) as the virtualization engine. After you install Kalabox you should be able to open up VirtualBox and see a VM called "Kalabox2".
* **Docker Machine** - We use [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) to handle the management of the Kalabox engine.
* **Boot2Docker** - We use [Boot2Docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker) as the actual VM image. Boot2Docker is a small ISO built on top of [Tiny Core Linux](http://tinycorelinux.net/)

!!! attention "Docker Beta for OSX/Windows"
    As soon as the Docker Beta for [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) and [OSX](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) becomes stable and has performant file sharing we intend to switch our backend over to that.

    This will greatly reduce our dependency chain, allowing for the removal of `docker-machine` and VirtualBox.

The engine should automatically start when needed if you are running a CLI or GUI command that requires it. **This can sometimes take up to 30 seconds.** Turning off the GUI (without force quitting) will also deactivate the engine.

### Turning the engine on or off

You should also be able to turn the engine on or off using these two hidden commands on the CLI

```bash
# Turn the Kalabox engine off
kbox down

# Turn the Kalabox engine on
kbox up
```

If you feel like the engine is OUT OF CONTROL and you want to try to manually kill it there are a few ways you can do that.

  1. Start/stop it through the VirtualBox GUI or VBoxManage CLI
  2. Start/stop the VM using the docker-machine utility

### Accessing the Engine directly

#### OSX

```bash
# You might want to consider adding this to your PATH variable
export DOCKER_MACHINE=/Applications/Kalabox.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/docker-machine

# This will drop you into the Kalabox2 VM
$DOCKER_MACHINE ssh Kalabox2
```

#### Windows

!!! note "Install Directory"
    This assumes you have installed Kalabox at `C:\Program Files\Kalabox`. Replace
    that directory below if your location is different.

```bash
# You might want to consider adding this to your PATH variable
set DOCKER_MACHINE="C:\Program Files\Kalabox\bin\docker-machine-exe"

# This will drop you into the Kalabox2 VM
%DOCKER_MACHINE% ssh Kalabox2
```

Engine for Linux
----------------

On Linux the Kalabox engine runs a custom docker daemon via the [docker engine](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine). This is an unsecure daemon which listens on `10.13.37.100:2375`.

### Turning the engine on or off

The Kalabox engine runs as a service. We support the `SysV`, `Upstart` and `systemd` init systems. By default the Kalabox service will launch when you boot your system but you can control it in the normal way.

```bash
sudo service kalabox start
sudo service kalabox stop
sudo service kalabox status
sudo service kalabox restart
```

### Accessing the engine directly

#### Linux

```bash
# Set your DOCKER_HOST to point to Kalabox
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://10.13.37.100:2375

# Might want to consider adding this to your path
export DOCKER=/usr/share/kalabox/bin/docker
$DOCKER info
```
