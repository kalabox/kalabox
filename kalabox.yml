# Core Kalabox configuration file
#
# This file specifies the core configuration options for Kalabox. If you
# wanted to fork Kalabox and use your own config this is the file you
# would want to change
#
# Alternatively you can also drop a kalabox.yml file in ~/.kalabox to
# override the settings found here
#
# There are other options beyond what are listed in this file that can be
# overriden although they are currently not officially supported.
#
# Do a `kbox config` to get a sense of what they are. This also should apply
# for kalabox.yml app configurations.
#

#
# Domain
#
# You can change the domain suffix used by default. The support level of
# this setting is currently unknown.
#
# domain: kbox

#

#     2. ./plugins
#
#   In the global plugin directory
#
#     1. ~/.kalabox/plugins

# below. Example:
